# Bonus Calculator - Migration Plan

## Migration Approach: Phased Rewrite with Strangler Fig Pattern

### Strategy Overview
We recommend a **phased rewrite approach** using the strangler fig pattern, allowing the new system to gradually replace the old while maintaining business continuity. This approach minimizes risk and allows for incremental value delivery.

### Migration Principles
- **Zero downtime** during migration phases
- **Feature parity** before component replacement
- **Data integrity** throughout the process
- **Rollback capability** at each phase
- **User experience** continuity

## Cutover Plan

### Phase 0: Foundation (0-30 Days)
**Objective**: Establish new infrastructure and development pipeline

#### Infrastructure Setup
- **New repository** with recommended project structure
- **CI/CD pipeline** setup (GitHub Actions/GitLab CI)
- **Development environment** containerization
- **Production infrastructure** provisioning (PostgreSQL, Redis)
- **Monitoring stack** deployment (Prometheus, Grafana)

#### Development Environment
- **Development containers** for consistent environment
- **Database migration scripts** from SQLite to PostgreSQL
- **Code quality tools** setup (linting, formatting, testing)
- **Security scanning** integration

#### Data Migration Preparation
```sql
-- New PostgreSQL schema with improved design
CREATE TABLE sessions_v2 (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now(),
    expires_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
    metadata JSONB DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb,
    migrated_from_old BOOLEAN DEFAULT false
);
```

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] New repository with complete project skeleton
- [ ] Local development environment running
- [ ] Production infrastructure deployed
- [ ] Database schema migrated to PostgreSQL
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline functional

**Exit Criteria**:
- New system can receive and process test data
- All team members can run full development environment locally
- Production deployment pipeline tested

### Phase 1: API Layer & Session Management (30-60 Days)
**Objective**: Replace session management and establish API foundation

#### API Gateway Implementation
- **FastAPI application** with improved routing structure
- **Session management** service with Redis backend
- **Authentication middleware** for future use
- **API versioning** and documentation
- **Health checks** and monitoring

#### Dual-Write Session Data
```python
# Session write to both old and new systems
async def create_session() -> SessionResponse:
    # Write to new system (primary)
    new_session = await new_session_service.create()
    
    # Write to old system (fallback)
    try:
        old_session = await old_session_service.create(new_session.id)
    except Exception as e:
        logger.warning(f"Old session creation failed: {e}")
    
    return new_session
```

#### Traffic Routing Strategy
- **Feature flag** to route session creation to new API
- **Gradual rollout**: 10% → 50% → 100% over 2 weeks
- **Monitoring** for error rates and performance differences
- **Automatic rollback** if error rate > 1%

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] New API layer handling session management
- [ ] Redis-based session storage operational
- [ ] Feature flags controlling traffic routing
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards for both systems

**Exit Criteria**:
- New session management handles 100% of traffic
- Response times < 200ms for session operations
- Zero data loss during cutover period

**Objective**: Replace file upload and processing with improved error handling

#### Enhanced File Processing
- **Streaming file uploads** for large datasets
- **Asynchronous processing** with job queues
- **Improved validation** with detailed error reporting
- **File storage** optimization (cloud storage integration)
- **Progress tracking** with WebSocket updates

#### Background Job System
```python
# Redis-based job queue for file processing
from celery import Celery

app = Celery('file_processor', broker='redis://localhost:6379')

@app.task
def process_uploaded_file(upload_id: str, file_path: str):
    """Process uploaded CSV file asynchronously"""
    try:
        # Enhanced file processing logic
        result = enhanced_file_processor.process(file_path)
        update_upload_status(upload_id, 'completed', result)
    except Exception as e:
        update_upload_status(upload_id, 'failed', str(e))
```

#### Migration Strategy
- **Parallel processing**: New system processes files alongside old
- **Validation comparison**: Ensure results match between systems
- **Gradual migration**: Route new uploads to new system
- **Legacy support**: Keep old system for historical data access

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Enhanced file processing service deployed
- [ ] Background job queue operational
- [ ] File validation improvements verified
- [ ] Progress tracking system functional

**Exit Criteria**:
- File processing success rate > 99.5%

**Objective**: Replace calculation engine with improved performance and accuracy

#### Calculation Engine Improvements
- **Parallel processing** for batch calculations
- **Improved precision** handling and rounding
- **Enhanced caching** for repeated calculations
- **Audit trail** for all calculations
- **Performance monitoring** and optimization

#### Calculation Validation
```python
# Dual calculation for verification
async def verify_calculation_accuracy():
    """Compare results between old and new engines"""
    test_cases = load_test_employee_data()
    
    for employee_data, parameters in test_cases:
        old_result = await old_engine.calculate(employee_data, parameters)
        new_result = await new_engine.calculate(employee_data, parameters)
        
        # Verify results match within tolerance
        assert abs(old_result.final_bonus - new_result.final_bonus) < 0.01
```

#### Rollout Strategy
- **Shadow mode**: New engine calculates alongside old (results not shown)
- **A/B testing**: Split traffic between engines for comparison
- **Confidence building**: Gradual increase in new engine usage
- **Full cutover**: Switch to new engine after validation period

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] New calculation engine with parallel processing
- [ ] Calculation accuracy verification system
- [ ] Performance improvements measured and validated
- [ ] Audit logging for all calculations

**Exit Criteria**:
- Calculation accuracy matches old system 100%

  return useNewComponents ? (
    <NewBatchUploadContainer />
  ) : (
    <LegacyBatchUploadContainer />
  );
}
```
