For each subtask, include specific acceptance criteria and technical considerations.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves both frontend and backend components with complex interactions. The column mapping requires a sophisticated UI for matching source columns to target fields, auto-mapping algorithms, and template storage. The task includes multiple API endpoints and stateful UI components, making it moderately complex. The provided code examples show significant complexity in the UI components."

For each subtask, specify the technical requirements, validation rules, and integration points with other modules.",
      "reasoning": "This task focuses on creating a parameter configuration interface with validation logic and integration with the calculation engine. While less complex than the column mapping task, it still requires careful implementation of validation rules (e.g., weights must sum to 100%) and integration with the batch processing workflow. The UI components need to handle interdependent values and provide immediate feedback."

For each subtask, include details on the reactive update mechanism, validation rules, and performance considerations for real-time updates.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating a sophisticated input panel with real-time calculation updates. It requires implementing numerous input controls with validation, maintaining consistent state, and ensuring responsive performance. The real-time calculation aspect adds significant complexity, as changes to any parameter must immediately update the calculation results. The interdependencies between parameters (e.g., weights summing to 100%) further increase complexity."

      "reasoning": "This task focuses on clearly presenting calculation results with appropriate formatting and detail. It requires implementing a breakdown of calculation steps, policy alerts, and export functionality. While not as complex as the calculation engine itself, it still requires careful attention to detail in presenting the information clearly and ensuring the export functionality works correctly. The optional visualization components would add complexity if implemented."

For each subtask, detail the data structures, user interface components, and backend integration requirements.",
      "reasoning": "This task focuses on managing and comparing scenarios in the Playground. It requires implementing functionality to save, load, and compare different parameter sets and their results. The complexity comes from managing scenario metadata, implementing effective comparison views, and maintaining version history or audit trails.
