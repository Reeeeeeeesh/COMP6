## NEXT METHODICAL STEP - RECOMMENDATION

Following the project motto: **"Meticulous Methodical Action - Think Do Think Do"**

### THINK: Current State Assessment ✅ COMPLETE
We have **60%+ completion (15+ of 25 tasks)** with robust foundation:
- ✅ Multi-tenant infrastructure with full security
- ✅ Complete expression engine with vectorized execution  
- ✅ Comprehensive API coverage (12 routers, ~4K lines)
- ✅ Advanced features (revenue banding, parameter presets)

### DO: Next Critical Step → **Task 22: RBAC with Role-Based Route Guards**

**Why this step:** Complete the security layer with fine-grained access control. This provides:
- Role-based route protection for admin features
- User authentication and authorization middleware
- Secure access to sensitive operations (plan approval, system configuration)
- Frontend route guards matching backend permissions
- Complete security audit trail integration

**Strategic Rationale:** With intelligent UX complete (76% done), secure the platform with proper access controls before production deployment.

**Current State Analysis:** User roles exist in models (`admin/hr/manager/auditor/readonly`) and approval workflow has role checks, but frontend lacks route protection.

**Implementation approach:**
1. Analyze existing role model and backend authorization
2. Create authentication context and middleware for frontend
3. Implement route guards for protected admin features  
4. Add role-based UI component visibility controls
5. Integrate with existing audit system for access logging

**Success criteria:** Users can only access features appropriate to their role with full audit trail
